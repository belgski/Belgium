Some people would have you believe that scaling back the government would save us soo much money that we could all afford a private jet.

In reality [we have seen](../expenditure/government.md#greedy-government) that while the government wastes disproportionally per capita, it's not **that** significant. If we trust the efficiency per capita metric proposed there, we can simulate how much money we would save if we got down to the level of another country.

To put it into perspective - this is how it compares to the deficit

A significant saving to be sure, not very realistic with all complications in Belgium, but not enough to get us to a net surplus.
