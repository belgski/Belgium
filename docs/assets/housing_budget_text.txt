The median household of a couple with two children has a yearly net income of 71793.7 Euro. 
    There is a rough rule of thumb that you should spend at most one third of your income on housing. 
    If we assume an interest rate of 3.5% and we take out of a loan for 20 years, then the maximum reasonable budget is 462439.3 Euro.
